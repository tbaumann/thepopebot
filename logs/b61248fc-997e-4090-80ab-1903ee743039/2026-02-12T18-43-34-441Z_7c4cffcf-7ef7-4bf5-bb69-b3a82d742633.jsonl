Skills Testing:\n   - Test a few basic skills that don't require external authentication\n   - Try skills like: web browsing, file operations, or other general-purpose tools\n   - Document which skills work and which fail (and why)\n\n3. Authentication Status:\n   - Check which skills require authentication/API keys\n   - Identify missing credentials (like the Google Calendar LLM_TOKEN)\n   - Document what's working vs what needs setup\n\n4. Generate Report:\n   - Create a summary in logs/ showing skill discovery results\n   - List working skills, broken skills, and missing credentials\n   - Provide recommendations for next steps\n\nFocus on verification rather than actual skill usage that might require credentials we don't have yet."}],"timestamp":1770921814449}}
