Examine the .pi/skills/ directory and see if it's properly linked to /pi-skills\n3. Test Pi's skill discovery mechanism - run `pi --list-skills` or equivalent to see what skills are actually discovered\n4. Check if there's a configuration issue preventing gccli from being found\n5. Investigate why the previous report ended up in /tmp instead of being committed to the repo\n6. Save this investigation report to logs/364c0f99-195f-4c8c-8898-3191da223d3c/gccli-skill-discovery-analysis.md so it's properly committed\n7.
