Read the gccli skill documentation at .pi/skills/gccli/SKILL.md to understand how to use it. Then:

1. Use gccli to list authenticated accounts with: gccli accounts list
2. Identify the user's account (should be the only one listed)
3. List all calendars for that account using gccli
4. Extract and report back the calendar names found

Provide a clean list of calendar names as the final output.
